### To-Do List

A clean, functional to-do list to keep track of tasks and check them off when they're completed.

### Calculator

A basic yet sleek online calculator where users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

### Pizza Restaurant Menu

Feel like a slice?  Choose your size and toppings and this menu will calculate your price.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This classic game of Xs and Os randomly rolls dice to select which of the two players goes first in a battle of wits, where the winner is celebrated with sound effects.
