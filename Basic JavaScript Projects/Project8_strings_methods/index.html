                <br><br>
                Would you, could you,
                on a boat?
                <br><br>
                I could not, would not, 
                on a boat.
                I will not, will not, 
                with a goat.
                <br><br>
                I will not eat them in the rain.
                I will not eat them on a train.
                Not in the dark! Not in a tree!
                Not in a car! You let me be!
                I do not like them in a box.
                I do not like them with a fox.
                I will not eat them in a house.
                I do not like them with a mouse.
                I do not like them here or there.

                I do not like green eggs and ham!
                I do not like them, Sam-I-am.
                <br><br>
                You do not like them. So you say.
                Try them! Try them! And you may.
                Try them and you may, I say.
                <br><br>
                Sam! If you will let me be,
                I will try them. You will see.
                <br><br>
                Say! I like green eggs and ham!
                I do! I like them, Sam-I-am!
                And I would eat them in a boat.
                And I would eat them with a goat...
                <br><br>
                And I will eat them in the rain.
                And in the dark. And on a train.
                And in a car. And in a tree.
                They are so good, so good, you see!
                <br><br>
                So I will eat them in a box.
                And I will eat them with a fox.
                And I will eat them in a house.
                And I will eat them with a mouse.
                And I will eat them here and there.
                Say! I will eat them anywhere!
                I do so like
                green eggs and ham!
                Thank you!
                Thank you, Sam-I-am!
